# Project Description

hDCX is a lightweight TypeScript wallet core SDK that simplifies digital credential management with few core operations. The SDK provides cross-platform support (Web, React Native, Node.js) while maintaining full compliance with modern standards including eIDAS 2.0, W3C VCDM 2.0, SD-JWT VC, and OIDC4VCI/VP.

# Alignment with the OpenWallet Foundation Mission

hDCX directly aligns with the Foundation's mission to enable anyone to easily build interoperable wallets. The SDK achieves this by:

- Simplifying Wallet Development: The APIs abstracts away complex credential protocols, allowing developers to build functional wallets without deep expertise in digital identity standards.
- Lowering Technical Barriers: Automatic format detection and protocol handling mean developers can focus on user experience rather than implementation complexity.
